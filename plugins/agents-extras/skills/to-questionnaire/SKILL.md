# To Questionnaire

Turn something the user cannot answer alone into a **questionnaire**: a Markdown document they hand
to one person to fill in async, or work through together in a meeting. The recipient holds knowledge
the user lacks; the questionnaire pulls it out of them.

**Grill the send, not the subject.** Interview the user only about the _send_, which they can always
answer: who it goes to, and what they need back. The questions in the document then target the
**gap** between what the recipient knows and what the user needs.

1. **Who is it going to?** Ask, in one exchange, the recipient's role, expertise, and relationship to
   the user. This fixes the tone and how much context the document must carry. Done when you know
   who the recipient is and what they know that the user does not.
2. **What do you need back?** Ask, in one exchange, the specific decisions or facts the user cannot
   resolve alone. Done when you have a concrete list of what the user must walk away able to do or
   decide.
3. **Write the questionnaire.** Draft questions aimed at that gap, following the structure below.
   Save it to `docs/resources/_inbox/<YYYY-MM-DD>-questionnaire-<slug>.md` when
   `docs/resources/_inbox/` exists — the answered copy comes back to the same place and feeds
   `distill-knowledge` — otherwise `to-questionnaire-<slug>.md` in the current directory. Report the
   path. Done when the file exists and every item from step 2 is covered by a question.

## Document structure

Frame it as a **discovery questionnaire**: the user lacks context, the recipient holds it. Order
questions most-important-first, since async may give you only one pass, and group them under `##`
headings by theme once there are more than a handful.

<questionnaire-template>

# <Questionnaire title>

**Purpose:** why this questionnaire exists and the decision riding on it.

**From:** <the user>, **To:** <the recipient>, **How your answers will be used:** <where they go>

## Context

One paragraph orienting a recipient who was not in the user's head. Enough to answer well, not a page.

## How to answer

Deadline and rough effort. Partial answers and "I don't know" are useful: flag anything you are
unsure of rather than skipping it.

## <Theme heading>

One `##` section per theme. Under each, its questions, most-important-first. Every question is one
idea, never compound, with an answer stub directly beneath, and a one-line _why this matters_ only
where the question could be misread or invite a throwaway answer.

<question-example>
### What load is the system expected to handle at launch?

_Why this matters: it decides whether we provision for burst traffic now or defer it._

## Anything else?

A closing catch-all: anything we did not ask that we should know?
