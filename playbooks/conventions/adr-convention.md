# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Convention

## Purpose

An ADR records *that* an architectural decision was made and *why* — so a future reader who looks at
the code and wonders "why on earth did they do it this way?" finds the answer instead of reversing a
deliberate choice. The value is in capturing the rationale and the trade-off, not in filling out
sections.

ADRs are the durable home for architectural rationale. They are distinct from
`playbooks/templates/AGENT_DECISIONS.template.md`, which is a lightweight per-task decision log for
agent handoffs within a single piece of work. Use an ADR when the decision will outlive the task.

## Location and numbering

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` with sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc.

- Create the `docs/adr/` directory lazily — only when the first ADR is needed.
- To number a new ADR, scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## Format

The body is one to three sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. See `playbooks/templates/adr.template.md` for a copyable
starter.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs won't need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`) — useful when
  decisions are revisited.
- **Considered Options** — only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering.
- **Consequences** — only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out.

## When to create an ADR

Offer an ADR sparingly. All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful.
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did
   they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for
   specific reasons.

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it — you'll just reverse it. If it's not surprising, nobody
will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there's nothing to record beyond "we did the
obvious thing."

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read
  model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not
  synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target.
  Not every library — just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other contexts
  reference it by ID only." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM because
  X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite. These stop the next engineer from
  "fixing" something that was deliberate.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We can't use AWS because of compliance requirements."
  "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered GraphQL and picked
  REST for subtle reasons, record it — otherwise someone will suggest GraphQL again in six months.

## Review checklist

Before committing an ADR:

- the decision passes all three offer-test criteria (hard to reverse, surprising, real trade-off)
- the filename is the next sequential number with a descriptive slug (`docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md`)
- the body states context, decision, and why — in as few sentences as the decision needs
- optional sections are present only where they add value, not as boilerplate

`grill-with-docs` (`playbooks/skills/engineering/grill-with-docs.md`) creates ADRs inline as decisions
crystallise during a grilling session, using this convention.
